    Hey, I&apos;m Rafa ðŸ‘‹. I like hacking on projects, playing with
    synthesizers, spending time in nature, and making field audio recordings.
    For now this site is only hosting my resume but stay tuned for a selection
    of field recordings from the caribian and some blog posts about fun things
    I&apos;m doing with Treesitter and Neovim.
